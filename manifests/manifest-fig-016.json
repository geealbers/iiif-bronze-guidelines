    "@value" : "<p>I first started with the Simple Annotation Server to mark up each step in the diagram in the order they appear. However, when I downloaded it, the steps were out of order and the styling of the SVG elements was inconsistent. So I instead wrote the annotations out manually, in as simple a format as possible. This included forgoing the SVG boxes in favor of the default URL xywh parameters, such as: \"on\": \"http://ca7e597a-499e-48a8-9ac5-bc0b1975821c#xywh=0,0,413,578\".</p><p>Diagram depicting a version of the lost-wax slush-molding process combined with ceramic shell casting. Based on Andrew Lacey (British, b. 1969), <em>The Anatomy of Bronze</em>, cast by the artist in 2019, Devon, UK, H. 45 cm (artistâ€™s collection).</p>",
